# Project Lines onto Topography

Projecting Lines onto Surfaces within Revit has been tricky for various reasons. One could argue that projecting lines  and modeling with primitives are precisely the kind of things Revit was designed to avoid; and I agree with this attitude. But, there are times when you simply want something done a particular way. Fortunately Dynamo can let you be that impish individual that you want to be within the Revit world.
